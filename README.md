# Practical OpenCV 3 Image Processing with Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Practical OpenCV 3 Image Processing with Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/practical-opencv-3-image-processing-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787126428), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
OpenCV is a native cross-platform C++ Library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. It is increasingly being adopted in Python for developing applications to process visual data such as photographs or videos. OpenCV has C++/C, Python, and Java interfaces with support for Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, and Android, and offers extensive libraries with over 500 functions.
This video demonstrates how to develop a series of intermediate-to-advanced projects using OpenCV and Python, rather than teaching the core concepts of OpenCV in theoretical lessons. Instead, the working projects developed in this video teach the viewer how to apply their theoretical knowledge to topics such as image manipulation, augmented reality, object tracking, 3D scene reconstruction, statistical learning, and object categorization. 
By the end of this video course, viewers will be OpenCV experts whose newly gained experience allows them to develop their own advanced computer vision applications.
